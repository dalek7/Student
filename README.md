## Level #01 Keras를 이용한 CNN 이해 및 활용하기
Intermediate activations are “useful for understanding how successive convnet layers transform their input, and for getting a first idea of the meaning of individual convnet filters.”

### 01 Visualizing what convnets learn (Visualizing intermediate activation in CNN )
